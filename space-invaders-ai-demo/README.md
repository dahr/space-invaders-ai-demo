git clone https://github.com/yourusername/space-invaders-clone.git
cd space-invaders-clone
```

2. Install dependencies:

## Running Locally

### Quick Start (Existing Project)

If the project is already set up with all files:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev      # For Vite projects
# OR
npm start        # For Create React App projects
```

3. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173` for Vite or `http://localhost:3000` for Create React App)

4. Play the game!

### For AI Developers

To run this app locally, execute these commands in sequence:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd space-invaders-clone

# Install all required packages
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will automatically open in your default browser. If not, manually navigate to the local server URL displayed in the terminal output.

## Project Setup (From Scratch)

### Option 1: Using Vite (Recommended)

1. Create a new Vite project:
```bash
npm create vite@latest space-invaders -- --template react
cd space-invaders
```

2. Replace the contents of `src/App.jsx` with the Space Invaders component code

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Option 2: Using Create React App

1. Create a new React app:
```bash
npx create-react-app space-invaders
cd space-invaders
```

2. Replace the contents of `src/App.js` with the Space Invaders component code

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Verifying Your Local Setup

After running the development server, you should see:
- The game centered on a dark background
- "Score" and "Lives" displayed at the top
- A "Start Game" button in the center
- Canvas size: 1200px × 800px
- Stars twinkling in the background

If the game appears offset or small, check that:
- All code from `App.jsx` is correctly copied
- No conflicting CSS files are overriding styles
- Browser cache is cleared (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

## How to Play

### Game Objective
Defend Earth by destroying all the flying saucers before they reach the bottom of the screen!

### Controls
- **Arrow Left (←)**: Move your rocket ship left
- **Arrow Right (→)**: Move your rocket ship right
- **Spacebar**: Fire bullets at the enemy ships

### Game Rules

1. **Destroy the Invaders**: Shoot all the flying saucers to win the wave
2. **Avoid Enemy Fire**: Flying saucers shoot back! Dodge their bullets
3. **Don't Let Them Land**: If any enemy reaches the bottom of the screen, game over!
4. **Watch Out for Collisions**: If an enemy ship crashes into you, you lose a life
5. **Lives**: You have 3 lives. Lose them all and it's game over
6. **Scoring**: Each destroyed enemy is worth 10 points

### Gameplay Tips

- Keep moving to avoid enemy fire
- Try to destroy the lower enemies first to reduce incoming fire
- The enemies move faster as they get closer to you
- Each new game features enemies in different colors!
- Watch for the animated explosion when you get hit - your ship will respawn after

## Game Features Explained

### Visual Elements
- **Rocket Ship (Player)**: Silver rocket with red nose cone, blue window, and orange fins with flame effects
- **Flying Saucers (Enemies)**: Classic UFO design with dome cockpit, cyan windows, and colored rim lights
- **Starfield Background**: Scrolling stars create a sense of movement through space
- **Explosions**: Orange and yellow fireball effects for dramatic impact

### Technical Details
- Built with React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Canvas-based rendering for smooth 60 FPS gameplay
- Collision detection for bullets, ships, and boundaries
- State management for game flow (start, playing, explosion, game over)

## Development

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev       # For Vite (opens on port 5173)
# OR
npm start         # For Create React App (opens on port 3000)
```

### Common Local Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview   # For Vite only

# Clear cache and reinstall (if having issues)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` folder (Vite) or `build/` folder (Create React App).
